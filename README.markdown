pug - persy's uncomplicated git
------------------------------
this is a git wrapper for python. 
it just wrapps the system calls in a nice class. 
i still need help with the packaging as deb and rpm (and egg?!?!). 
you can copy it right now in your project and get going!

you can redirect the output and input of the commands. 
per default every output is suppressed. 
take a look at the stdout, stdin and stderr parameters of the class and the functions.
