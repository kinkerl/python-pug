pug - persys uncomplicated git
------------------------------
git wrapper for python. 

this is not even ready for anything. it works in persy (and you can take a look how its done) but i still need help with the packaging as deb and rpm (and egg?!?!) to be usefull. or(!),you can copy it right now in your project and get going!
